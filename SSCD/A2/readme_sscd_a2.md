# Assembler Pass 2 (Java)

## Overview

This program implements a simplified **Pass 2 of an assembler** using Java.
It reads intermediate code (IC) generated by Pass 1 along with predefined symbol, literal, and opcode tables, and produces corresponding **machine code output**.

The implementation demonstrates core assembler concepts such as address resolution, opcode translation, and directive handling.

---

## What the Program Does

* Loads:

  * **Symbol Table (SYMTAB)** — maps symbol indices to memory addresses
  * **Literal Table (LITTAB)** — maps literal indices to memory addresses
  * **Opcode Table (OPTAB)** — converts mnemonic opcodes into machine opcodes
  * **Intermediate Code (IC)** — instructions produced by assembler Pass 1
* Processes each IC line based on its type:

  * **IS (Imperative Statements)**

    * Translates opcode
    * Resolves register and memory operands
    * Generates machine instruction
  * **DL (Declarative Statements)**

    * Handles `DC` (Define Constant)
    * Emits constant data into memory
  * **AD (Assembler Directives)**

    * Ignored during machine code generation
* Outputs:

  * Location Counter (LC)
  * Generated machine code

## Approach / Design

1. **Data Structures**

   * `HashMap` used for SYMTAB, LITTAB, OPTAB
   * `ArrayList` holds intermediate code lines
   * `ICLine` class models each instruction

2. **Processing Flow**

   * Tables and IC are initialized (`loadTables`, `loadIC`)
   * Each IC line is passed to `processLine`
   * Operands are resolved using:

     * Symbol lookup
     * Literal lookup
     * Constant extraction
   * Machine code is formatted and printed

3. **Key Methods**

   * `processLine()` — decides handling based on type
   * `resolveRegister()` — converts register field
   * `resolveOperand()` — resolves symbol/literal/constant
   * `getConstant()` — extracts numeric values

## Requirements

* Java JDK 8 or later

Check installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

## How to Compile and Run

1. Save file as:

```
AssemblerPass2.java
```

2. Compile:

```bash
javac AssemblerPass2.java
```

3. Run:

```bash
java AssemblerPass2
```

## Sample Output

```
LC      Machine Code
----------------------------
500     581800
501     5A3603
...
```

(Actual output depends on tables and IC content)

---

## Notes

* This is a **demo implementation** — tables and IC are hardcoded.
* Not intended to be a full assembler.
* Can be extended to:

  * Read tables from files
  * Support more directives/instructions
  * Add error handling
  * Improve instruction formats
